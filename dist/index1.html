  <!-- LONG VERBATIM NIRAIYA CONTENT (DO NOT REMOVE) -->
  <section id="niraiya" class="py-5 bg-white">
    <div class="container">
      <article class="lead">
Recover Your Lost Excel Passwords in Minutes - Niraiya Makes It Simple
Ever been locked out of your own Excel file? We've all been there. You created that important spreadsheet weeks ago, set a password to keep it secure, and now... you can't remember what it was. Maybe it's your budget tracker, a work project, or that research data you spent hours organizing. Don't panic - Niraiya is here to help.

The Problem Everyone Faces
Let's be honest - passwords are a necessary evil. We create them to protect our important files, but then life happens. We use different variations, add numbers we think we'll remember, or mix up which password we used for which file. Students lose access to their thesis data right before deadlines. Employees inherit password-protected files from colleagues who've moved on. Small business owners get locked out of their financial records when they need them most.

Traditional solutions? They're either expensive (think $200+ per file), slow (taking days or weeks), or require downloading sketchy software that might harm your computer. Worse yet, most services want you to upload your entire file to their servers - not exactly ideal when you're dealing with sensitive financial data, personal information, or confidential business records.

Why We Built Niraiya Different
When I started working on Niraiya, I had one simple goal: create a service I'd actually want to use myself. That meant three non-negotiables:

Privacy First: Your Excel file never leaves your computer. Seriously. We process everything locally in your browser and only send the encrypted bits we need to crack the password. Your actual data, formulas, and content stay put.

Actually Fast: We use AI and cloud computing to crack passwords in minutes, not days. While other tools are still trying the millionth combination of "password123", our smart algorithms have already figured out your actual password.

Fair Pricing: Password recovery shouldn't cost more than your monthly coffee budget. We charge reasonable rates because we believe everyone deserves access to their own files.

Here's How It Actually Works
No technical jargon, no confusing steps. Just a straightforward process that gets you back into your Excel file:

Drop Your File: Drag your password-protected Excel file into our secure web page. It starts working immediately - no waiting for uploads because the file isn't going anywhere.

We Extract the Lock: Our browser-based tool examines your file and extracts only the password encryption information. Think of it like taking a picture of the lock without touching the treasure chest.

AI Does Its Magic: That encryption info goes to our cloud servers where artificial intelligence analyzes patterns, tries intelligent combinations, and uses advanced techniques to crack the code.

Get Your File Back: Download your unlocked Excel file with all your data intact. Usually takes 5-15 minutes, sometimes less.

Real Stories from Real Users
Sarah, Graduate Student: "I had three months of research data locked in an Excel file and couldn't remember the password. My thesis was due in two days. Niraiya saved my degree - literally got my file back in 8 minutes."

Mike, Small Business Owner: "My bookkeeper left and took the passwords with her. I needed those financial reports for a loan application. Other services wanted $300 per file. Niraiya did it for a fraction of that cost."

Jennifer, IT Manager: "We inherited tons of protected Excel files from a company acquisition. Niraiya helped us unlock dozens of configuration spreadsheets without compromising security or breaking our budget."

What Makes Us Different (The Honest Truth)
We Don't See Your Data: Other services require you to upload complete files. We process locally and only work with encrypted password hashes. Your spreadsheet content never touches our servers.

Speed That Actually Matters: Desktop software uses your computer's limited power. We tap into serious cloud computing resources - the same infrastructure that powers modern AI applications.

Multiple Attack Strategies: We don't just try random combinations. Our system uses dictionary attacks, pattern recognition, common password variations, and machine learning to find the most likely candidates first.

Works Everywhere: Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android - if it has a modern web browser, it works. No downloads, no installations, no compatibility headaches.

Honest Success Rates: We can crack most Excel passwords, but we're upfront when we can't. Complex 20+ character random passwords? Probably not happening. But that forgotten combination of your pet's name plus your birth year? Usually takes minutes.

The Technical Stuff (Without the Headaches)
Our system handles all Excel versions from the ancient Excel 97 files to the latest Microsoft 365 formats. Whether it's XLS, XLSX, password-protected worksheets, or encrypted workbooks - we've got the tools.

The AI behind Niraiya learns from every password recovery attempt. It gets smarter over time, recognizing patterns in how people create passwords. Most folks don't use truly random passwords - they use meaningful words, dates, and numbers. Our algorithms exploit these human tendencies to crack passwords faster.

Security-wise, everything runs over encrypted connections. We automatically delete all recovery data after processing. No storage, no logs, no trail of your files on our systems.

Common Questions People Ask
"How long does it really take?"
Most passwords get cracked in 5-15 minutes. Older Excel versions are faster. Newer, more complex passwords might take longer, but our AI significantly beats traditional brute-force methods.

"Will you mess up my spreadsheet?"
Never. We only remove or recover the password. All your data, formatting, formulas, charts, and macros stay exactly as they were.

"What if it doesn't work?"
Some passwords are genuinely uncrackable - long, random strings with no pattern. We'll tell you quickly if yours falls in that category. You only pay when we succeed.

"Is this legal?"
Absolutely, when it's your file or you have permission to access it. We're designed for legitimate scenarios - forgotten passwords, inherited files, authorized business recovery.

Who Uses Niraiya
Students and Researchers: Protecting thesis data, group projects, academic research. When deadlines loom and passwords disappear, we're the panic button that actually works.

IT Professionals: System admins dealing with legacy files, inherited documentation, configuration spreadsheets from previous employees.

Business Users: Accountants, analysts, consultants who work with client files, financial models, reports where passwords get lost in communication.

Personal Users: Budget trackers, home inventories, family financial planning - all those personal Excel files we protect but then forget how to access.

Pricing That Makes Sense
We're not trying to charge enterprise rates for a service students and freelancers need. Our pricing scales with your needs:

Single Recovery: Perfect for that one file that's driving you crazy. Pay only if we succeed.

Professional Plans: For consultants, accountants, and professionals who occasionally need password recovery.

Business Solutions: Volume pricing and priority support for organizations dealing with multiple protected files.

Privacy Protection (The Details That Matter)
Look, privacy isn't just a marketing buzzword for us - it's how we built the entire system. Here's exactly what happens to your data:

Your Excel file gets processed locally in your browser using WebAssembly technology. We extract only the cryptographic hash of the password - essentially a mathematical fingerprint that tells us nothing about your actual content.

That hash gets sent to our servers over encrypted connections. Our AI systems analyze it to determine the original password. Once found, we send back just the password - not your file, not your data, just those characters you forgot.

Everything gets automatically deleted within hours. No permanent storage, no data retention, no backup copies sitting on our servers.

What's Coming Next
Right now, we're laser-focused on Excel files because frankly, they're what people need most. But we're already working on expanding to Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and VBA projects. The same privacy-first approach, the same AI-powered speed, the same fair pricing.

Ready to Get Your File Back?
Stop stressing about that locked Excel file. Whether it's a critical work document, important personal data, or academic research, Niraiya can probably help you regain access in minutes, not days.

We've designed everything to be straightforward, secure, and affordable. No complicated software to download, no technical expertise required, no worrying about your private data ending up on someone else's servers.

Try Niraiya today and see why thousands of users trust us with their Excel password recovery needs. Fast results, complete privacy, honest pricing - that's not just our promise, it's how we've built every part of our service.

Your data deserves better than generic password crackers and expensive recovery services. It deserves a solution built for real people facing real problems. That's Niraiya.
